Perfect — since **Dav/Devs Paper** is your **design system + component library** (built in React, Tailwind, and TypeScript), and you’re already tracking your dev time at **S$26/hour**, we can turn that into a few simple **low/no-code pricing models** that:
✅ reflect your real work value,
✅ don’t require heavy backend logic,
✅ and can scale later if you decide to productize it.

---

## 💰 BASELINE

**Hourly value:** S$26/hr
If each component (with docs, testing, and examples) takes ~4 hrs, your *build cost per component* ≈ **S$104**.
We’ll use that as your internal benchmark for pricing tiers.

## 🧱 OPTION 1: Component-Pack Pricing (One-Time)

**Best for**: Early adopters or indie devs wanting to buy reusable code

| Tier                        | What’s Included                                                     |  Suggested Price |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------: |
| **Free Kit**                | 5 basic UI primitives (Button, Card, Typography, IconButton, Input) |         **Free** |
| **Pro Pack**                | 15–20 polished components with props, themes, and docs              |  **S$49 – S$79** |
| **Extended / Team License** | Full source access, tokens, utilities, updates for 1 year           | **S$99 – S$149** |

🪄 **No-Code Setup:**

* Use **Gumroad** or **Lemon Squeezy** to host the ZIP + docs.
* Add “license type” options.

## 🧭 OPTION 2: “Paper Pro” Membership

**Best for:** recurring income while keeping low setup effort

| Plan        | Access                                          |                       Price |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------: |
| **Free**    | View docs, use CDN build                        |                      **$0** |
| **Creator** | Download code, get new components monthly       |   **S$8/mo** or **S$80/yr** |
| **Studio**  | Access to design tokens, Figma kit, early betas | **S$16/mo** or **S$160/yr** |

🪄 **Tools:**

* Stripe hosted checkout (no backend).
* Memberstack / Lemon Squeezy for gated pages.
* You could gate component downloads or live previews.

---

## 🧰 OPTION 3: “Buy Me a Feature”

**Best for:** indie supporters who want specific components

* Public Trello or Airtable wishlist of upcoming components.
* Each card has a **“Fund This”** link (e.g. S$26 × estimated hours).
* When funded, you build it → they get early access or shout-out.

🪄 **Tools:**

* Use **Buy Me a Coffee**, **Ko-fi**, or **Stripe payment link** per component.

---

## 💎 OPTION 4: Project Use License

**Best for:** agencies or client work

* **Single-Project License:** S$49
* **Unlimited Projects:** S$129
* Include a short EULA (you can host it in Notion or markdown).
* Track via Gumroad license keys (auto-generated).

---

## 🧮 OPTION 5: Internal ROI Model (for your logs)

You can tie this to your tracker:

```
Component Build Time × $26/hr = Dev Cost
Price = Cost × 1.5 (profit margin)
```

So if a component took 3 hours →
Cost = S$78 → Price = ~S$118 (rounded to S$119).

Would you like me to **mock up a pricing table section** for your Dav/Devs Paper landing page (in Paper theme, using your typography and color tokens)?
I can format it in JSX/Tailwind so you can drop it right into your docs site.
